course description
This course is an introduction to the system of lm, and its various forms, styles and genres. We will be
studying a wide variety of texts (canonic Hollywood lms, documentaries, shorts, animation, art and
experimental lms) as a way to further an understanding of the visual, aural and narrative conventions
by which motion pictures address social and aesthetic experience. Through the course lectures,
readings, clips and discussions, we will explore the multiple functions of lm, conventional and
alternative ways of reading a lm text, and will develop the critical tools necessary for thinking and
writing about lm as both an art form and as a medium that re ects popular culture.

student learning outcomes
#1 Demonstrate an understanding of the professional, technical, historical and stylistic choices that
realize, develop, or challenge existing practices and traditions of lm.
* Explain the basic formal and stylistic elements involved in the lmmaking process.
* Articulate the core concepts of narrative storytelling and character development in popular lm
forms (Hollywood, independent, world, documentary, and avant-garde).
#2 Analyze, interpret, and exercise critical judgement in the evaluation of the fundamentals of lm as
a performing/visual art form.
* Identify the various genres and styles of lms that have evolved over the course of lm history.
* Write clear, concise and well developed analyses of lm texts.
#3 Recognize and articulate contemporary lm terminology/basic theory and use them to examine
the nature of culture, class, gender and ethnicity in Hollywood mythologies and oppositional
lms.
* Examine the codes and the conventions of lm genre, style, myth, narrative and rhetoric.
* Evaluate research on, and popular claims of cinema’s social, political and individual effects.
* Read and interpret popular lms as artifacts of a given culture and representations of different
social/political/cultural ideologies.

Class Lectures: This course is asynchronous, which means that there is no live instruction and you are
responsible for engaging with the course materials on your own each week. Copies of the slides and
video lectures will be made available in the modules section on Canvas each week and will remain
open for the duration of the semester. My goal is to aid in the development of your analytical/critical
skills, so I expect everyone to maintain an open mind and take a creative approach to the material. Be
respectful of your fellow classmates when addressing and critiquing con icting viewpoints. If you
require any accommodations such as a note taker, testing services, captions, or special chairs/desks,
please speak with me personally, or provide the proper authorization letter from the Disability Support
Of ce (DSPS).

Required Course Materials: It’s incumbent upon you to be prepared, so I expect that you will review the
lecture materials and read through the assigned readings each week. All readings are located in the
course textbook (info below) or available as a downloadable le in the ‘Modules’ section of Canvas:

Engaging Cinema, by Bill Nichols. New York: W.W. Norton, 2010.
Digital and print copies of the course text are available for checkout via the CRC
Library Page or the Internet Archive. All lecture slides, video lectures and select
articles are available as downloadable les in the ‘Modules’ section of
canvas.losrios.edu.

assessments and grading
There are 500 total points available in the course and your overall grade will be determined by your
performance on the following assessments:
Film Clip Analysis (150 pts.)
Film Screening Analysis (150 pts.)
Film Form Writing Assignment (100 pts.)
Film Style Writing Assignment (100 pts.)

A = 500 - 449
B = 448 - 399
C = 398 - 349
D = 348 - 299
F = 298 - 0

Film Clip & Screening Analysis Assignments: You are required to analyze each of the assigned screenings
as well as the sets of lm clips from the video lectures—I expect one-page of analysis for each screening
and one-page of clip analysis for each lecture topic. This is a good habit to practice when watching and
analyzing lms, as it will help you to maintain a critical mindset throughout the process of viewing.
This notebook is due in Canvas during the nal week of the semester.
Film Form & Style Writing Assignments: There are two writing assignments this semester, each due by
11:59pm on the assigned date. Late submissions for the Film Form assignment will be accepted for up
to one week and will incur up to a 10-point penalty. No late assignments will be accepted after one
week. There will be no opportunity for re-writes after grading, as solid writing skills are a must in this
course—all writing assignments must be turned in via the Canvas LMS.
** NOTE ** The grades/percentages in Canvas are constantly in ux as the semester advances. If you
want the most accurate representation of your grade, do the math using the above guide to assess your
current standing, or to calculate what scores you may need on future assignments to achieve your
grade goal. All writing and analysis assignments must be turned in via the Canvas LMS. Review the
‘Assignment Guide’ in Canvas for more information about the assignments—all due dates are listed on
the schedule below. Plagiarism, the use of AI technology and other issues concerning academic integrity
will not be tolerated, and are grounds for an automatic failure in the course. Acknowledge all reading and
research sources with the appropriate footnotes or bibliography. Keep all copies of your assignments/
materials until you have received a nal grade for this class.
