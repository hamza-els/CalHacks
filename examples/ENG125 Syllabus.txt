Course description

How should engineers analyze and resolve the ethical issues inherent in engineering?

This seminar-like course is designed to introduce undergraduate students to the concepts and exercise of ethical practice in the engineering discipline.  As the boundaries between science, engineering and technology are increasingly blurred, this course will take a maximally broad interpretation of engineering ethics, and thus we will draw from case studies from all STEM fields as well as the field of medical research. 

The weekly two-hour plenary class will make frequent use of videos and prominent guest lecturers, which will be the launching point for highly interactive discussions, short in-class polls, and exercises.  The parallel discussion sessions will be dedicated to reviewing important case studies in the engineering discipline, student presentations on “Ethics in the News”, and real-time team exercises, e.g. mock Institutional Review Board (IRB) for human subject research proposals. 

A topic of special interest will be Research Integrity, to prepare the students for actual ethical challenges they would encounter after joining a research group of a faculty Principal Investigator.

 

Course objectives

    Understand professional responsibilities and define personal professional values
    Build, practice, and demonstrate analytical skills for evaluating ethical dilemmas within engineering
        Recognize ethical dilemmas
        Analyze contexts
        Apply various ethical frameworks

        Engage with different sources of information
        Lead discussions with peers
        Determine, justify, communicate a recommended course of action
    Introduce theories, concepts, methods from the humanities which can be applied to ethical analysis in engineering

Policy on Use of Generative AI

In accordance with Code of Student Conduct regarding plagiarism and the Berkeley Honor Code, any work submitted as your own should be your own original work. Generative AI may be used as a resource that is properly cited, but it may not be used to produce work that you then submit as your own, just as you may not copy a peer’s work.

 

Accommodations

If you require course accommodations due to a physical, emotional, or learning disability, contact UC Berkeley’s Disabled Students’ Program (DSP). Notify the instructor and GSI through email of the accommodations you would like to use. You should have a Letter of Accommodation on file with UC Berkeley to have accommodations made in the course. Our goal is to maintain enough flexibility in the course expectations that all students might have a positive learning experience.  If you have an accommodation, it is strongly recommended that you meet with the Professor early in the semester.

Students in the class can receive a free digital subscription to both the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.  You should read one or both daily; in particular the coverage of technology and corporate ethics by the Wall Street Journal is comprehensive and incisive.  Following their stories, often by their own investigative reporting, will be essential to the “Ethics in the News” sessions in the discussion sections. Instructions to get free subscriptions to the NYT, WSJ and other journals are found here:
